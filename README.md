# Tetromino Packing Challenge

Hi! This challenge will test your problem-solving and programming skills. And perhaps
even be an interesting way to spend an evening. ðŸ™‚

The project is a web app running entirely in the browser. It uses React, but you don't
need to be familiar with React to work on the challenge. Some TypeScript knowledge would
be beneficial, but you should be fine with modern Javascript as well.

## Getting started

To build this project, you will need NodeJS installed.

I strongly suggest you build and run the web app first and play around a bit
to get a feel for what is going on. The code will make much more sense after you
have seen what it does.

To run the webapp, run `npm start` in the project directory.

Then head over to the `CustomPackingStrategy.ts` file in `/src/TODO`, read through the
comments, and get coding.

Good luck!

## Available NPM Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
